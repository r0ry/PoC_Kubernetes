# PoC_Kubernetes


## Prerequisites

*	.Net Core 2.2
*	Docker (toolbox if working with VB)
*	VirtualBox
*	Vagrant
*	Postman (Testing) 

## Installation

### Setup VMs
*	$ git clone https://github.com/r0ry/PoC_Kubernetes.git
*	$ cd ~/Rancher/vagrant 
*	$ vagrant up 
### Setup Services
*	Open in browser 172.22.101.101 (may depend on your VM setup)
    * Default credentials: admin/admin 

*	Deploy workloads ( [Rancher_Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/workloads/deploy-workloads/) ) 
NOTE: Consul needs to be deployed first and the values in the fields must match exactly for Service Discovery to work properly. This is explained further down.

## Service Discovery

* ðŸ’¥ Services are responsible to register themselves with Consul
* ðŸ’¥ Combination of Rancher and Consul is used for Service Discovery so it is important that the names of the services match exactly. The workflow here is as follows:
*	When registering to Consul services use Rancherâ€™s service discovery - [link](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/service-discovery/)
*	Once they are registered OcelotGw uses this information to reroute, auth and authz 

## Identity Server

For development Id Server is deployed in Kubernetes with port mapping, but ideally it must have its own static IP.
Client Credentials Flow is used to request tokens. 

![Alt_Text](https://i0.wp.com/www.bubblecode.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/client_credentials_flow.png?resize=525%2C396)

Client_id, Client_secret, Scopes and Claims are stored in memory. These are further used by Ocelot to authenticate and authorize the client.

## OcelotGateway  

Routing, Authentication and Authorization is done according to the docs: [Ocelot](https://ocelot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Postman Testing

* Request token from IdServer. Use Type OAuth 2.0 with parameters:

    *	Grant Type: Client Credentials
    *	Access Token URL: __http://idserver_address/connect/token__**
    *	Client Id: ocelot
    *	Client Secret: secret
    *	Scope: gwapi

* GET __http://ocelot_address/api_route__**

## Current issues and suggestions 
*	Tokens can be past in the header rather than asking for new 
    *	Example: Postman -> ValuesAPI -> CatalogAPI 
*	Consul fails to deregister using CLI. Services are able to deregister themselves
*	IdServer can use introspection endpoint to validate reference tokens
*	Ocelot Gateway currently doesnâ€™t support Swagger
*	Each service currently registers to Consul. This is done using the same code sample in each service. A Registrar service may be helpful here.
*	Deployment of services can be done using Helm
